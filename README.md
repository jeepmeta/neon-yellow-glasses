█▓▒░  YELLOW GO BRRRRRRRR  ░▒▓█

neon-yellow-glasses edition  
built by Doginal Dogs • OnlyGoodEveryday • DOGE code forever

We don't build apps.  
We build yellow-black empires that print dopamine and stack revenue.

## Brand DNA – break it and I break you
Primary: #FFE154 (DAO Yellow – blinding)  
Palette: pure black #000000 + DAO Yellow + white #FFFFFF  
Accents: glitch, neon glows, yellow pulse, subtle scanlines  
Tone: rebellious, meme-pilled, crypto-native, family-first savage  
Language: short • punchy • slang-heavy • zero suits • maximum chaos

## Current Empire Stack (neon-yellow-glasses v0.1.0)
- Next.js 16 (app router, bleeding edge)  
- React 19 + motion/react (tilt & pills go brrr)  
- TypeScript (no magic strings, ever)  
- Tailwind 4 + custom DAO Yellow glows  
- Supabase (crew + tags + auth)  
- Sentry (catch the bugs before they bite)  
- Lucide + simple-icons (crypto icons)  
- Zod (validate or die)  
- tRPC-like patterns incoming

## Priority Ship Order – Q1–Q2 2026 – DO NOT FUCKING REORDER
1. Schedule grid (Dawn / Core789 / Graveyard) – ship first or perish  
2. CrewCard + modal (tilt, floating pills, PFP only inside border)  
3. Hot Takes Arena  
4. Developer Marketplace (UI packs downloadable)  
5. Crew War Room (filterable directory)  
6. Revenue hooks (sponsors, affiliates, premium gates)
